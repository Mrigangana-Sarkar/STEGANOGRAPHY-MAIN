Steganography-MAIN

Introduction

This project implements Steganography, the practice of concealing messages or information within other non-secret data (such as images, audio, or text). The system allows users to securely hide and retrieve messages within image files.

Features

Image-based Steganography: Encode secret text messages into image files.

Decoding Functionality: Extract hidden messages from steganographic images.

User-friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for embedding and retrieving messages.

Secure Encoding: Ensures message integrity and protection against casual detection.

Technologies Used

Python: Primary programming language for encoding and decoding algorithms.

OpenCV: Image processing and manipulation.

PIL (Pillow): Image handling and transformation.

Tkinter: GUI for user interaction.

NumPy: Efficient numerical operations.

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Mrigangana-Sarkar/STEGANOGRAPHY-MAIN.git
cd STEGANOGRAPHY-MAIN

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application:

python main.py

How It Works

Encoding a Message

Load an image file (PNG, JPEG, etc.).

Input the secret message.

Click "Encode" to embed the message into the image.

Save the newly created steganographic image.

Decoding a Message

Load the steganographic image.

Click "Decode" to retrieve the hidden message.

View the extracted text message.

Example Usage

Encoding

from steganography import encode
encode('input_image.png', 'Hello, World!', 'output_image.png')

Decoding

from steganography import decode
message = decode('output_image.png')
print(message)  # Output: Hello, World!

GUI Interface

A Tkinter-based graphical interface is available for ease of use.

The GUI allows users to select images, input messages, and encode/decode data effortlessly.

Applications

Secure Communication: Hide confidential messages in images.

Watermarking: Embed ownership information in digital assets.

Data Security: Conceal sensitive information from unauthorized access.

Future Enhancements

Support for additional file formats (e.g., audio and video steganography).

Enhanced security with encryption.

Improved message capacity without affecting image quality.

Web-based interface for broader accessibility.
